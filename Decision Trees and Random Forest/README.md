### Using data sourced from Lending Club

I will be classifying the data and predicting whether or not a particular borrower has paid their loan back 100%

Snip of data:

 Customer Fico score vs Did they pay back loan fully or not
 
 0 = they didn't
 
 1 = they did

Next we can look at another feature, the purpose of the loan and how man paid back fully and how many did not
